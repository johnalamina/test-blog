  <h3>Welcome to primo!</h3>
  <p>You're mere minutes away from having more fun making websites than you thought possible.</p>
  But first, you'll need to do two things:
  <ol>
    <li>create an account</li>
    <li>connect to a hosting provider</li>
  </ol>
  <p>That's it! I'll see you on the other side.</p>

  <p>If you run into any issues along the way, click the <i class="fas fa-life-ring text-red-400"></i> in the bottom left. That'll take you to our Discord #help channel where you can, well, ask for help.</p>
